Don't even bother with this product! I bought this and was so excited because the picture of it looked so cute and who couldn't resist a $7.00 piece of lingerie that cute? But when it finally arrived (three weeks past due) I opened the package to find a lump of blue and pink material. It's as thin as paper with half ass stitching (fabric was sewn crooked or loped-sided) plus the bust is only meant for women who have like DDD's! Overall VERY disappointed in this product and would not recommend it to anyone
