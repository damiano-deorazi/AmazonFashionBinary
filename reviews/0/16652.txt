No children's pj's should have to be air dried or dry cleaned.  I did not read the tag (my fault) because I never would have thought that fleece pj's for a baby would have special care instructions.  I tumble dried these pj's and the zipper ripped off on my daugher's first wear.  If you air dry everything or don't mind having to remember to separate this out, than they were fine.
