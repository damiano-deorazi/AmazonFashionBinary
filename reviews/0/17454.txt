Before I ordered this I carefully checked the measurements and said oh it will fit great, also the jacket appeared slightly different than the picture. For example the drawstring in the picture is under the skull which would be great meaning the jacket was that long, the drawstring was in the middle of the skull. Very displeased for the first time ever with my order, although to follow up the company was very understanding and extremely helpful with returning the product.
