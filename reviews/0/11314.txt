This is deplorable. I live in Dallas where we have fought for over a year to bring justice to the abusers of a dog who was burned and skinned. I adopted a dog in not much better of a condition, who was starved and beaten by people who trivialized the value of her life. The sight of something like this is absolutely sickening and the thought that this can gain revenue for your company or any other is disturbing.
