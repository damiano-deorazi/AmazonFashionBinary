I bought a small, which I wear in everything. Not only was this top tight, but it is short. The depiction shows the shirt reaching past the hips, but it did not fit this way for me, just barely past my hips and not flattering. Also, I didn't find the material stretchy as it appears in the picture and therefore, uncomfortable.
