The product itself is of good quality. In some ways, it is much better than my issue M65 Field Jacket. The sizing is what ruins it. When I say too large, I'm literally drowning in it.

There were so many reviews on this product, and so much misleading information. It becomes even more confusing if you are on the borderline of two different sizes.

When I enlisted in the Air Force, I was 5'7, 147lbs. I wore a medium-regular, and it fit perfectly.

Fast forward to today, I'm 5'7, 185lbs. I ordered a medium from Amazon. The tag reads medium-regular. It is way TOO BIG.

Right now, I'm on the verge of a medium or large with T-Shirts and Jackets. It just depends on the maker. With Columbia, Nautica, Nike & Oakley I wear Medium. With Gildan T-Shirts, I wear a Large.
