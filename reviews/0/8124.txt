These shoes seem to be excellent quality, BUT after reading the reviews I ordered a size 5 as well as a 5.5 because I knew they ran small. They don't fund small, they run ridiculously, absurdly small. My daughter wears a size 4 street shoe with a tiny bit of extra room, and both the 5 and the 5.5 were beyond way too small. I'm rating them 1 star for quality - the inconvenience of and hassle keep me from giving them a single star more. What is so hard about accurately and consistently sizing a shoe??
