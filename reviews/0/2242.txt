I am so disappointed.  These socks are soft and when I first tried them on, they did offer comfortable support, so I thought I would try them for a day on my feet at work.
Not long after I arrived at work, I could feel the sock bunching around my toes.  I fixed this, but it continued throughout my day.  The support part of the sock begins just at the base of the toes, so this section would work its way forward as I walked, allowing part to gather under my foot.  The sock wasn't loose or too big, so I am not sure why they were designed this way.
My feet were sore by the end of my shift, so I will not even be wearing them a second time.  Quite the waste!
