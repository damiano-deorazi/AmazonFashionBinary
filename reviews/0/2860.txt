I am a small 56 120lbs woman, I wear womens XS clothing so I ordered a pair of small sweatpants because I wanted them baggy.  The pants come up to the underwire on my bra and are tight from waste to mid thigh.

I passed them on to my stringbean boyfriend who is 56 and 117lbs.  They are tight in him as well, which is a first, but the rise would still accommodate a buttcrack that extended up to his armpits.

Slenderman, if you're out there, these sweats are for you.
