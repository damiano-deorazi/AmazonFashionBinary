This is my third belly band and is by far the worst! I loved the other two brands I've gotten, but this one was soooo itchy and miserable to be in I took it off every chance I got! The best one to get is the bamboo belly bandit. Do not waste your money on this one, unless you enjoy scratching yourself all day!
