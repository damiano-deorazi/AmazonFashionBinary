Not only was it not at all like pictured ( it was light pink with  purple tipped feathers), its feathers are falling out all over the place. We ordered it for a Cheshire cat prop for Halloween. Even if it came on time ( which it was a day after Halloween) it wouldn't have even looked right. We ordered it because it was supposed to be a dark pink and purple. This was horrible.
