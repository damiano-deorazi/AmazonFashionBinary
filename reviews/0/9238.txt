The reviews made this necklace a huge bust for me. To be honest I expected something amazingly beautiful and worth well over the $13 I payed for it. Normally I wouldn't buy something so inexpensive.

You get what you pay for. The chain itself is decent, but pretty bulky. To put it in perspective this looks like a small version of the  "gold chain" rappers wear. Definitely bigger than the picture would have you believe.

The pendant would be crazy beautiful... if it wasn't obviously made of cheap plastic. The cheap plastic that leaves ugly fingerprints on the backside of it and I feel like every time I open it I almost break it. Also, don't overlook the part in the title where it says (1"). This pendant is huge! Actually look at a ruler and see for yourself how big 1" is before you buy this. You do need to be able to fit a picture or the like inside of it but it really is big.

Overall I am extremely disappointed, and let's just say I'm not giving this to my girlfriend.
