OK, Sorry but we have a problem!  The "Pink" pair of Dr. Scholl's Women's 2 pack Spa Low cut socks have been worn several times and has NO problems.  The BLACK pair didn't make it a "Hour" without loosing several of the Non Skid dots!!!  My sister thought they were some kind of BUG!!  Not a good thing!!  The dots were on the Kitchen, Bathroom floors and on her carpet.  Some of the Letters are loose and just kind of hanging on loosely. With my sister being disabled and has sight and stability problems this sock will be given away and I don't think there will be any other orders made for this type of socks.
