These serve as thick compression TIGHTS not LEGGINGS!  I don't know why there should be a $10 price difference between the tights and leggings when the leggings are COMPLETELY see through in the rear!

You cannot wear these with a shirt.  You need a long tunic or dress.  I was well within the weight/height parameters for my size.  Check the other reviews, I am not the only one with this complaint!

They do offer good compression during pregnancy but I would consider them winter-esque tights and not leggings.
