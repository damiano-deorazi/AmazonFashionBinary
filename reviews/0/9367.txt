This looks beautiful in the pictures online. Heck, I could lay this out on my counter and get great pictures. The problem comes when I paid almost $20 for something that  I could have gotten out of a gumball machine. The metal is a light aluminum and is very thin with sharp edges on the inside. The chain isn't worth a penny and the S hook used to join the two is a piece of dung. One wear and it breaks. You are better off spending your money on something that will last longer.
