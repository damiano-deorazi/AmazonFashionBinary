The jumpsuit portion was not grey like in the picture but light blue...my wife said all she could think of was ralphie from a christmas story and his deranged pink bunny outfit, when she saw me try it on. It fits like the gown you put on before surgery.  Open in the back but wedgie central down below...Not for the modest...the helmet is the best part but is flimsy and  Velcro's together.  The tinted portion of the helmet for seeing is very blurry much like having cataracts in both eyes..I bet the first thing I run into will crack the helmet.  Which is the best looking part of the costume.
