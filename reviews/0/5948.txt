This would be a great product if I was standing a majority of the time. It held everything in and you could visibly tell if I had been wearing it during the day or not (I would pooch out more if I hadn't been wearing it for a while).

As a brand new mom, however, I did everything I could to stay off my feet. When sitting, the Belly Bandit would get pushed up and off my stomach, to mash painfully into my (tender) breasts. I used it daily for a week (starting two weeks postpartum), off and on for another two weeks, then almost never after that. Now, 7 weeks postpartum, I look pretty much the same as I did before I started wearing it. I might have had better long-term results if I had been able to wear it until I could start working out again, but it was just too uncomfortable to sit in.

There's really no curve to this product, nor anything to keep it from riding up. Next time I'll be looking into something that goes between the legs like the Bellefit.
