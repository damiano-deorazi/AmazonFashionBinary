DO people REALLY think pants are going to "tone" their legs??

Anyway, I purchased these hoping they would be flattering for the gym and not show sweat.  You know, cause the only way to "tone" is to actually work out and build muscle.  Silly women.  The fit was awful and the back pockets were too small and poorly placed (making your derriere look hyuge. They were also just too thick for me.  I know they are compression pants (which improve recovery, NOT "tone") and are thick as a result, but they were just too thick for my comfort.
