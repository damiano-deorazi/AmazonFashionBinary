These really should not be a "one size fits all" product... I'm not a plus size by any means but these are still far too small to fit around my thighs. They're so tight there that it is painful to wear them. I am currently a bit over my ideal weight and I do need to lose some weight but I get the feeling that even when I do get to my ideal weight these won't fit me properly.
