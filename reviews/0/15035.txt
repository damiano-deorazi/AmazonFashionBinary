ordered on the 17th of September and received on the 21 of October- over a month to get it. I live in NYC- so its not like they have any excuse other than they had someone strap it to their back and swim it over... or maybe outsourced it to a sea turtle. I asked where it was- I got no response until I gave them a bad seller review. I took it down- not sure why because the customer service was so bad but apparently they had estimated more than a month to get and that was in 2 days.... . Anyway, but this is so not worth the price nor the wait and the return is UK which costs more to return.
