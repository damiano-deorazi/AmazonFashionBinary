The finger holds ripped off literally 2 minutes after my daughter put the wings on.  She put the straps over her shoulders, fingers in the finger holds and started to run off with her new wings.  The first finger hold immediately ripped. The second one ripped just a few minutes later.
Don't buy these wings - try a different maker.
