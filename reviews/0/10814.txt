I really liked how these fit but the material was awful - stiff and scratchy. I usually wear Greys Anatomy scrub pants, so I wasn't expecting that kind of softness for half the price, but i also wasn't expecting a road rash on my inner thighs after my 12 hour shift. I thought the fabric might soften up a bit after washing, but this time I got a rash on my inner things and bum only 6 hours into my shift. I would never buy these again or recommend them. Kudos to Amazon for a painless return process.
