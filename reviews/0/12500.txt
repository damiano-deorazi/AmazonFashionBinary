The day I received this purse I automatically put it to use. A few hours later I went shopping I took my wallet and left the purse in my car. When I arrived at my car 20 min later there was a terrible smell. I didn't think anything of it until I got home and realized the smell was coming from the purse!! Not sure what kind of material is used but it has a horrible dead animal smell! Would NEVER buy again!
