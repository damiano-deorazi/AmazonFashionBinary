I ordered a Wing Collar Tuxedo Shirt with Pique Bib Front made by Neil Allyn in size 17 neck.  I already have one of these by Neil Allyn, like it, and wanted another as backup. What was delivered was a shirt made by a company called "Classix" in size 17 1/2 neck.  FIt is way too large, not a good fit like the Neil Allyn one I already had.  Not worth the  bother and expense of shipping the Classix one back.  This Classix shirt will be donated to the local thrift store. Buyer beware.
