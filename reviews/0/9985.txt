It truly looks NOTHING like the photo. It has strange button/button holes in the front that make it look very off balance. It looks very cheap and the shipping TOOK FOREVER. It fits NOTHING like the model, and the sleeve slits are horrific. The picture is very deceiving. I know the price is good, but for those who work hard and very rarely purchase things for themselves, I am very disappointed to have spent my money on this.
