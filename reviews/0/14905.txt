I don't care what it says on the package this is a children's wig. My sister has a smallish head and this wig did not fit well at all. It fit my 7 year-old nephew perfectly (he wanted to try it on!).
The curls do not lay very well and do not look as full as the picture.
 I bought the Bob Rainbow Wig for $20 and got a great costume wig I can wear for years (maybe only once or twice a year but how many occasions call for a rainbow wig). This wig doesn't fit, looks like crap, and will be unwearable after one party.
