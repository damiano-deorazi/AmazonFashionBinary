I ordered this bracelet as a Christmas gift to my best friend and ordered one for myself, thinking it would be of good quality for the both of us.

I was disappointed with this product

For starters, it was too big for my wrist so I absolutely knew it was too big for my best friend.  The clasps holding the bracelet together were of low quality and it was put together sloppy.  So sloppy that the third day of wearing it, the chain came off and the clasps broke.

While the price is nice, it's not worth the wait to get this bracelet. I was pretty embarrassed knowing this gift arrived in her mailbox.
