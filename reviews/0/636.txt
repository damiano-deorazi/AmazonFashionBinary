The quality level of this shirt did not meet expectations.  Numerous construction flaws, in nearly every aspect of the shirt.  I returned it and purchased the 100% cotton version, with french cuffs, also by Neil Allyn.  Now this shirt is what I was expecting.  For just a little more money, the 100% cotton shirt is made well and fit perfectly.  I highly recommend you avoid the poly/cotton shirt and get the 100% cotton version, even if you only think you will wear it once!  It is worth it.
