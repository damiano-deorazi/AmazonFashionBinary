THIS JUNK IS USELESS.  BOTH LENSES WERE TOTALLY BLURRED. HOWEVER, COLORS WERE  RECOGNIZABLE.  SEVERAL PEOPLE ATTEMPTED TO USE THEM WITH LAUGHABLE RESULTS.  BEWILD GENEROUSLY GAVE ME PARTIAL CREDIT UPON RETURN OF THE DEFECTIVE GLASSES.  I HOPE THIS WILL SAVE YOU THE TEN DOLLARS I WASTED.  BE SURE TO READ BEWILD'S RETURN POLICY.  IT IS NOT THE SAME AS AMAZONS.
