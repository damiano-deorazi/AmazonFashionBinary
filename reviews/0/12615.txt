I loved this handbag. I saw the bad reviews but liked the bag and I have been looking for one for so long. I decided to try it. Mistake. The metal clasp on the side broke off, the first day. I just went to Walmart, got home and saw it was broken. The front zipper on the pocket was also very touchy, just a matter of time before that broke as well.
