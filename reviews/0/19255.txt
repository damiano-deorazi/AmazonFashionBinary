No size option and it is way too short. I wanted a big chunky sweater for these cold winter days and this was not at all it. I'm only 5'3" and the front is above my waist, and the longest part in the back still hits right at my hips. So it doesn't fully cover my butt. I live in leggings and oversized shirts and sweaters in the winter and this was a waste of money.
