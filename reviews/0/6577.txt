Never thought I would be writing a review on such a small, basic item.  Actually forgot about it.  Just took the loss.  I received it, started wearing it after a month, did not take it off for approx 8-10 weeks and it actually fell off one day in the shower.  Looked at it and it had stretched an inch in one area and snapped.  Luckily, it happened where I did not lose the charm I had.  Previously, I had the charm on a cheap cord that came with it that I purchased in Hawaii and thought since the original lasted almost 2 years that this thicker cord would do at least the same...wow, I was wrong.

>>>Edit:

The vendor just emailed me and said they were going to replace with a rubberized one...they responded within a few hours.  Nice.  Please don't take my rating of the cord to represent the rating of the vendor, they were fast and courteous.  Maybe like all products, I got a bad one.
