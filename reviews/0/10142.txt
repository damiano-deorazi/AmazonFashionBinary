I've been looking everywhere for a small gold hoop earring for my cartilage piercing and these are perfect! They are perfect size and easy to put in and take out. The gauge was just a tad to big for my piercing so the first time i put it in was a little painful. My ears are usually sensitive to cheap jewelry and these do not irritate my ears. GREAT quality!
