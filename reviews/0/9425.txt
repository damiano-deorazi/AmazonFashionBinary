I bought these shoes for my Halloween wedding. I wear a size 6.5-7, but the size 7 of these shoes was way too tight. They are also very hard and uncomfortable. They are still sitting in the box. Luckily I have artistic talent and was able to paint a plain pair (I got cheap at Payless) to look just like them.
