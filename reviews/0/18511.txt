I wanted to have an extra swimsuit bottom however this material is so thin and does not seem like swimsuit material.  I would not feel secure in wearing this at the pool.  It just seems too thin and too lightweight.  the fit was good however it read that it was Spandex so I thought it would give me some control--I did not feel any control or feel secure wearing this.
