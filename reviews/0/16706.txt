Well they're cute, no doubt about that. But they are super bent. Clearly that's not due to shipping, considering they came in a cardboard box, but cmon dude. They sit lopsided on my face. I have tried to bend them back myself but they just keep going back to their misshaped frame. I am le disappoint.
