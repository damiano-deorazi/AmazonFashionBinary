Would've liked to use this belt, however, I ordered a size 36 (2" larger than my waist) as instructed.  Upon receiving the belt, I had to stretch it too much to be comfortable.  The size indicated on the inside of the belt was 36", however, comparing it to my other 36" belts, it was a full 2" shorter than those.
