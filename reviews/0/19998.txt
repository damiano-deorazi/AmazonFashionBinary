I thought these were allergy safe, but they are not at all. I wore one pair and my lobe is still swollen and horrible weeks after wearing these a few hours. DO NOT BUY THESE. I threw them away. They are pretty, but obviously made with super cheap materials. Something is very wrong with these earrings.
