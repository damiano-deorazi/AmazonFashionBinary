The umbrella that was sent to me was clear,I suppose, but with hideous polka dots all over it in opaque primary colors. This umbrella is not as pictured above!! If you are over 12 years old, you don't want to be seen with an umbrella like the one you will receive! If dots are you're thing, know also that it's also MASSIVE and rather heavy.
