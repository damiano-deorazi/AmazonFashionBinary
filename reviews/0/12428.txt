I loved this shirt in the picture but no..The buttons are really strange looking and the sleeves do not fit right. They are short ending Halfway up my forearms, the material is like a light weight sweater . I got a large even though I usually get a M, cause I wanted it to be a little bigger but the seams don't lay right on.. The sweater is large but the sleeves are short and one is longer than the other.. I don't like it.
