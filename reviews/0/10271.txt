I've never done a review before on Amazon, but this last transaction changed that. When I first saw these clothes from Allegra K, I was so excited. I felt that they perfectly fit my style, and I seriously couldn't believe how cheap they were (Of course, that should have been a tip-off, but I have gotten so many things for cheap on Amazon, I was just wishing this lucky streak would continue). I searched for reviews on this line, or even this seller (regarding the clothes), but found nothing. At the last minute, I splurged and placed my order. I got the package super quickly, but none of the ten things I bought were wearable. Even though the material looks like classy chiffon/silk in the pictures, it is basically fabric that costumes are made out of. On top of the cheap fabric, the construction was terrible: seams were coming undone and stitching was crooked. Many of the tops had collars that were off-center and/or way too large (like a pilgrim costume). Two of the items had stains (one looked like spilled black ink, while the other looked like yellow-white paste). I was so sad after trying on all the items, thinking at least one would work out. I'm leaving this review on the all the pieces I bought so others thinking of purchasing these seemingly cute garments are sparred the disappointment. I emailed back and forth with the seller and they granted me a full refund. The sellers seem understanding, but the pictures are deceiving and the clothes are unwearable.
