These are every bit as good, if not better, than the Archcrafters 'custom' shoe inserts I've gotten a few times after using their foot measuring foam thing. I require a good amount of arch support, and these deliver them in spades. As someone who wears those Archcrafters, and then Birkenstocks around the house due to their great arch support and stable heel cup, I didn't find these stiff or cumbersome. I found them soft but supportive. And the 11-11.5 size I got fit right into multiple 11 size shoes. 3 of these is the price of one Archcrafters. No brainer.
