This hat has great features, such as an inner adjustable band to make the hat fit growing toddlers over a longer period of time, as well as an adjustable chin strap.  I was looking for a sunhat for my 1 year old twin boys though, and this style is far from unisex.  It looked like a big floppy flower on their heads, even in the khaki color.  Would have been very functional and very stylish with a little sundress, but sadly this purchase went back.
