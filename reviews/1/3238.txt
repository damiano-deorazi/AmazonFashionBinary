Bought this for my 15 year old daughter and it was perfect.  We added a boa from Michaels Craft Store and a cheap pearl necklace.  It was the perfect outfit and she will be able to wear it again. Quality wasn't excellent, but it was definitely decent quality and held up great through a night of running around and hanging with friends!
