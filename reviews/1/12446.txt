My doctor seemed to think I had a heel spur in my left heel (I didn't have x-rays to confirm so it may have just been plantar fasciitis). I bought these with little hope that they would help.  They felt a bit awkward at first in my shoe because of their shape but within about two weeks the pain was completely gone.  I had done stretches also to help with the pain and it may just be a coincidence that it healed within the same time that I purchased these but I would buy these again in a heartbeat!  Well worth their price.  If anything at all, they are great cushions for your feet in general!
