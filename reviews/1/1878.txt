Although I though they seemed a bit stiff and imitation, by son asked me to buy a second pair when his first became too small.  He's 10, and we had tried on other boots that were much more expensive.  I do think that a better brand would give you more comfort for everyday use, but he is quite content with these and wears them a couple of times a week.  Can't ask for more than to keep them happy!
