I was hard pressed to find a new pair of shoes for a important trip. At the last minute I bought a $200 plus pair of shoes from a brick and mortar store. At home found out they would not work. Cannot find full selection of sizes at those stores anymore. Found the size I thought I needed on Amazon and had rush delivery. Felt good right away, and on trip just got better. Whew, close one. Thank you Amazon.
