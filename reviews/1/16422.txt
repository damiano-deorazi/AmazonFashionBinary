Great hat. Lots of other parents have asked me where I got it. Just wish the straps were velcro instead of ties; it's tough to get it tied onto a squirming one-year-old. But once it's on, it stays on, despite his pulling at it. It does slip back a bit, which then exposes his face to the sun, but I think that would be the case with any hat that is being yanked at. Lots of back of the neck coverage, which is great. The 6-12 month size is a perfect fit, with some give for growth in the partially elasticized band. My son is 13 months, but his head is 95th percentile, if that tells you anything.
