After trying many cures and remedies, these got rid of my plantar fasciitis!
I play tennis 5 times a week but had to stop for a while due to severe pain. After a week using these, I was able to get back on the court.
The are not magic, I still had to ice my feet and not play too much. But they helped a great deal.
