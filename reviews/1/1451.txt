Face it: every wide brim hat is not exactly a style statement. But many are flat out dorky and ugly.  This one, however, I love.  It looks like a fedora, not a sun hat.  And as to doing its job of sun protection, it is very good.  The brim keeps sun off of my face and neck, areas where I have had to have squamous cells removed. My body temperature is cooler with the hat on than off. The open mesh allows heat to escape and for any breeze to cool my head.
My only possible caveat: the mesh is a fairly open weave. If one is bald and must keep sun from the crown of the head, then it could be a problem.  The top of the hat is solid and will protect from the noonday sun. The mesh would only be an issue for early/late sun coming in at an angle.
