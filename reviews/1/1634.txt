We had originally received a defective helmet from an Amazon seller.  The defect was in the visor.  The visor would not stay shut even though we had followed the directions and only used the button for opening.  However, Aeromax toys offered a replacement helmet to replace the defective helmet that we had received .  I have now edited my original review.  We have now received the new helmet and are very pleased with it.  Aeromax toys was very kind and professional, and I am impressed that they reached out to us.  My little astronaut is very happy with her new helmet!  We now have a complete costume and have been happy with all of the the other Aeromax astronaut products.  Thank you Aeromax toys.
