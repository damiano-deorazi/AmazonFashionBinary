I bought these for my wife who absolutely loves them.  They're simple yet well built that I think she'll be able to wear them for quite some time.

Edit: Third time buying these just recently. They last about two years of regular use before they finally go which I think is great. Purchased in 2012, 2014, and 2016. Looking forward to buying them again in 2018.
