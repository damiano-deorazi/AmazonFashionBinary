I ordered this as an impulse buy about a month before Halloween, and I do not regret it. It fits exactly as in the picture (I'm 5'5"-5'6"and 130-135 pounds) and it looks super cute! I wish it came with gloves, but I will just buy those and fishnet stockings separately, making it still cheaper than comparable outfits at Halloween or party supply stores.
