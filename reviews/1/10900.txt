I wear a D width shoe, but can easily buy mainstream shoes by New Balance, Easy Spirit, Aerosoles in a D width. I thought these would be the perfect thing to help add support to my work shoes (flats, low heeled shoes). These orthotics are made for legit orthotic shoes that you have to order specially made. The orthotics were so thick that I couldn't fit my shoes on my foot. I will be returning and trying the Powerstep SlimFit 3/4 length.
