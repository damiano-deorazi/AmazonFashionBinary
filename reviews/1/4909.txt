My measurements in Wrangler, Wrangler RIGGS, and 'most' other brand pants is 40-42" Waist, 34" Inseam (this is for Loose fit clothing).
For Carhartt (Loose Fit pants) I ordered one size larger [than Wrangler] based on customer reviews / recommendations (from Amazon, Sierra Trading Post, and Working Person Store) and this hindsight worked perfectly; 42X34 fits great. The pants are SOOOO comfortable and give a very-very good amount of crotch room (you won't be adjusting your underwear / removing weggies every time you sit down / stand-up).

*If you like Wrangler Loose fit products and HATE having inadequate crotch-room I highly recommend these pants, just order one size larger (in the waist) than your normal size. Hope this helps!
