I purchased some awesome boots made with a really soft Italian leather that I didn't want to crease by just letting them flop in my closet.  I researched all the options for inexpensive, yet effective boot trees and chose Boot Shapers. PERFECT!!!  Easy to use if you compress them in the right spot and they hold my boots in perfect shape.
