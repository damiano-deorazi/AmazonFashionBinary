Assuming the wood is doing its job I'll give it 4 stars. The product is a bit big despite getting the size they recommend for my boot size. The rail that connects the front and back portion gets stuck and grinds a bit, nothing that keeps you from working with it but you need a little elbow grease to put the boot tree inside your boots.
Again assuming the product is doing its job then it's still a four star product because it does what it's supposed to and my complaints don't have an effect on that. If it isn't wicking and my boots start smelling eventually then this would be a 1 star.
