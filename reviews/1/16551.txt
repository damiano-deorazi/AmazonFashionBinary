I purchased these hats for my little girl and they were PERFECT! I love that they were longer in the back to help protect her neck. I was able to fold up the flap in the front for her to see and it had the drawstring on it to help keep it on in the breeze. it does have a tie below the chin but she hated that and so I picked my battle and never tied it and she left it on her head so I feel as though I won! I would recommend these for little ones that are out in the sun. This was also the perfect little shade for when in the water too. They washed up just fine in the laundry. :)
