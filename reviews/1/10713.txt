I have plantar fasciitis and have trouble finding good shoes in my town.  I wanted some good supports I could interchange in my shoes.  I read a lot of reviews, and settled on these supports.  They are as described!  They fit in my tennis shoes, but not in my dress shoes.  They are very comfortable.  I wear wide width shoes, and these are just a tad narrow for my shoes, not my feet, but I read someone secured theirs with sticky back velcro, so I gave that a shot, and it works beautifully keeping the inserts in place.  These are budget friendly and a great product.
