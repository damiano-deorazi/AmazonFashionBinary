This hat is lightweight but protective and my baby doesn't try to remove it at all. I appreciate the drawstring clamp on the crown of the head to tighten it around her head but also love the neck string to hold it on. We washed it/dried it using the machines and it came out looking brand new!  This is definitely something we'll be using for a long while!
