First of all - super cute hat! Second - my daughter's definitely not going to get a sunburn in this thing! And considering we like to drive with the top down sometimes in sunny Colorado, that's a major selling point. Also, the ties keep her from pulling it off, where she's a pro at ripping off velcro tie hats. Would definitely buy again; thinking of picking up a few as gifts.
