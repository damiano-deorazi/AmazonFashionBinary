I normally wear a size 42x30 in jeans, however when I received my pair of these Carhartts they were much too small. They couldn't be buttoned, so I was forced to send them back and get a size larger. I'm currently waiting for the replacements now. However, I do like these pants, quite a bit. Its obvious that they are really well made, and are sturdy for day to day work. I was a bit bummed that they didn't fit, but i liked them enough to re-order another pair. When I receive them, i'll be sure to give my final verdict. Until then, Four stars all the way.
