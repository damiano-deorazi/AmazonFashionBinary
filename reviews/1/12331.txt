I use prescription inserts and Powerstep Regulars are the very best OTC insert I have found. They are so good, they are in all my shoes and sneakers and I don't buy the $400 prescription inserts any longer.  Each insert can last through at least 2 or 3 pairs of casual rubber-soled shoes. They are firm, with strong arch support and no thick padding under the heal. I find padded insoles are a gimmick and elevating the heal makes shoes no longer fit right. The surface is a low friction cloth. The frame is rigid as it should be, and not foam.

I have pronation and weak arches. These go into my Red Wings, Fryes, Sketchers, Blundstones, dress shoes, Asics.  They are intended for runners but work great in all my shoes. In running shoes (all shoes, really), these replace the stock insert liners. It took years of searching to find these. My podiatrist recommended them, and lost a lot of business!

Highly recommended. Easily worth money.
