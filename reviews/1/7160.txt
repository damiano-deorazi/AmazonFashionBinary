Vans.
Been wearing them for 32 years. from the beaches of California to the streets of D.C. even the canyons of Zion, Red Rock and North Rim.
I know they start a little tight, but stretch perfectly.
Great for Hacky Sack, summer days at the beach... and for causing new and interesting aromas when worn without socks, heheheh.
I wear 10.5 US Mens... these fit as expected. Always they start a bit snug. I wear them a few hours at a time until they stretch and get a little torn here and there.
Funny thing is, there is no real arch support in these things - and they only come in one width that I know of - and of course, I wear at least an E width in boots - and I have arches that rival any bridge... but they never make my feet hurt...?
.Only 5 stars for now...
