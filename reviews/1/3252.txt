This flapper costume worked perfectly for the 20s party I attended.  I was worried about sizing so order 2 sizes.  I consistently wear a size 6 and got the medium and large. The medium fit but was pretty tight. The large fit perfectly and I was very comfortable.  The headband was a great addition!  I ordered some cheap costume pearls and my costume was complete!
