The bodice is lined with a weird foam stuff, so it was necessary to wear something under it for comfort's sake. Overall, the costume is pretty decent quality, apart from the boot toppers. Those things were a joke. They tore pretty much every time I tried to pull them up. You're better off just throwing the stupid things in the trash as soon as you get it. The rest of the costume is nice though, and fit pretty well.
