I ordered the Lemon yellow and Pink striped socks and they are great. I'm 5'8 and they came up mid-thigh. But unfortunaly they won't stay up. They roll themselves down after awhile of wearing them and they do make my thighs look a little chunky. I'm only 120 pounds and it does make me mildly self-conscious but I found wearing a cute garter belt with them keeps them up and makes my legs look nicer. :) For sure worth the purchase all and all.
