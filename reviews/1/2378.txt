My 9 y.o. daughter was clear - she wanted a messenger bag, preferably in turquoise with at least 3 pockets.  This bag fit the bill perfectly!  It has 3 large pockets which all close with heavy-duty zippers.  The largest pocket is big enough to carry a 3-ring binder, lunch bag, several books, notebooks, folders and a jacket.  There are several smaller pockets internally for pencils, small notebooks, phones, etc.  The handle is broad enough to not twist easily and can be adjusted to fit shorter or longer bodies.  She has only used it for 3 weeks but so far, it seems like it will hold up well throughout the year and she loves it!  The bag we bought is mostly turquoise with a bit of white near the bottom.  It is not the plaid one shown in the photo.
