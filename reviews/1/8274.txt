I bought size L. The trunks fit perfectly to my 12 years old boy, 90 ponds . Because many people are confused which size to choose my Suggestion: refer to the pounds shown in the chart, not the letter size and years. As we all know kids are different so there is no way 9-10 years old boy that weights 90 pounds, to fit in size M ...it  will be small.
